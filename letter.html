        <h2>Re: Elieen Dover University application</h2>
        <p>Dear Elieen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's scinece faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sectins.</p>
        
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>

        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us art any time, however it would suit us better if you could starty at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows: 
        <aside>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>
        </aside>    
        </p>


        <p>Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter">important university dates</a> on our website.</p>

        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>At the Awesome Scinece Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded reasearch facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in hte realm of science and technology . You seem like an intelligent, dedicated reasearcher, and just the kind of p[erson we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows,in order of priority:
            <aside>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefits of Reveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of fun bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C(86&deg;F),when the audience side exponentially increase (effect of 3&times;10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3&times;10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                    <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>    

                </ol>
            </aside>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other reources,and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.

        </p>


        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

        <p>Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tyribal dances.To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows,with definatioons:
             <br><br>Polynesian chicken dance
             
        <blockquote>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a hwole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitfil".</blockquote>

        Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <blockquote>Before the Icelnaders developend fire as means of  getting warm,they used to practice this dance, which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floow, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very reapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern style such as Twerking.</blockquote>

        Arctic robot dance 
        <blockquote>An interesting example of historic misinformation, Englishh exploreers in the 1960s belived to have discoverd a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered taht they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</blockquote>
